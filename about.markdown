Nice to meet you!

I'm currently a third year student at the University of Waterloo studying **Computer Science and Combinatorics & Optimization**. 

My previous experiences include two internships at AMD where I first worked as a software engineer on the kernel mode driver team. I later joined the SDK and technology team to work on multimedia SDKs. I've also worked as a backend developer at [Stealth Monitoring][stealth-monitor] for my first coop.

My main interests include [hardware-accelerated machine learning][hardware-accel], operating systems, parallel programming and optimization.

I'm open for internships for Fall 2021 and Spring 2022.
